# Research Paper Guideline Generator (RPGG)

## Project Overview

The **Research Paper Guideline Generator (RPGG)** is a tool designed to assist researchers and students in navigating academic research papers by generating a structured guideline based on a provided topic. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning, RPGG curates and ranks research papers based on their difficulty level, allowing users to gradually deepen their understanding of a specific subject.

This tool facilitates research by reducing time spent on literature review, enhancing accessibility, and enabling efficient topic discovery. RPGG exemplifies the power of AI to revolutionize academic research by organizing resources, guiding knowledge acquisition, and fostering collaborative learning.


## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Input your research topic easily to receive organized guidelines.
- **Preprocessing Capabilities**: Automated text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization.
- **Unigram and Bigram Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of term frequency and distribution.
- **Similarity Calculations**: Uses Cosine and Jaccard similarity to rank research papers by difficulty.
- **Personalized Guidelines**: Customizable results based on user preferences for a tailored experience.
- **Error Handling**: Intuitive feedback and error handling mechanisms for seamless user experience.


## System Design

1. **User Interface**: A simple, accessible interface to enter topics and retrieve guidelines.
2. **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization using NLTK and other Python libraries.
3. **Unigram and Bigram Analysis**: Distribution of linguistic units to gauge the difficulty and relevance of research papers.
4. **Model Integration**: GPT and other NLP models assess similarity and generate coherent guidelines.
5. **Guideline Organization**: Papers ranked by difficulty, enabling progressive learning.
6. **Error Handling**: Clear feedback for input errors or processing issues.
7. **System Deployment**: Scalable and secure, suitable for cloud, local, or web deployment.


## Technical Components

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaforsadek/Research-Paper-Guideline-Generator-RPGG.git
   ```

3. Set up Google Colab for GPU support if needed.


## Usage

1. Run the main application file, inputting your research topic.
2. RPGG preprocesses the input and uses NLP models to generate a guideline.
3. View results ranked by difficulty in a structured output format, ready for research exploration.


## Future Work and Improvements

- **Refinement of Difficulty Ranking**: Incorporate readability scores and additional similarity measures.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Expand customization options and personalization settings.
- **AI-Driven Enhancements**: Implement AI-based feedback for more accurate paper recommendations.
